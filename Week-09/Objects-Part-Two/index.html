<span class='emphasis'>DRY</span>
(Don't Repeat Yourself) is the act of programming modularly. Most high-level programming languages provide a way to build in a modular fashion, whether that's as simple as routines or functions, or as sophisticated as classes.
</p>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>Classes</span>
are used to encapsulate an idea and create a blueprint. They
<span class='emphasis'>describe</span>
a potential object; its properties; its functionality. Most C-based languages offer classes.
</p>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>Below, I'm demonstrating classes in 2 languages:</span>
<strong>C++</strong>
demonstrates class building in a strict environment;
<strong>PHP</strong>
demonstrates class building in a loose environment. Regardless, both examples accomplish the same task:
<span class='emphasis'>Create a blueprint to make a person object.</span>
</p>

<div class='col-sm-6'>
<h3>Classes in C++</h3>
<pre><code class='language-cpp'>class Person
{
  public:
    // properties
    string name;
    integer age;
    vector<string> interests;

    // constructor
    Person (string name, integer age, vector<string> interests)
    {
      this->name = name;
      this->age = age;
      this->interests = interests;
    }
    
    // methods
    string bio ()
    {
      return "Hello I am " + name + 
        " and I am " + age + " years old.";
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<h3>Classes in PHP</h3>
<pre><code class='language-php'>class Person {
  // properties
  public $name;
  public $age;
  public $interests;
  
  // constructor
  public function __construct ($name, $age, $interests) {
    $this->name = $name;
    $this->age = $age;
    $this->interests = $interests;
  }

  // methods
  public function bio () {
    return "Hello I am " + name + 
      " and I am " + age + " years old.";
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-12'>
<p class='content'>
However, neither of these exist yet in our application as accessible objects. At least, not until we instantiate them. They are simply blueprints of what an object can be and can do. The benefit of this is that we can have as many objects as we want. Each one can have a unique name, age, and set of interests, but all of them will follow the same format. If later we decide we want to add a new property to only one of our objects, we wouldn't be able to without adding the property to the class, or moving that property to a derived (child/inherited) class.
</p>
<p class='content'>
That's why many developers love/get confused by JavaScript's objects. They aren't classes. They aren't as constrained or controlled as classes are. They are as dynamic as JavaScript is allowing more flexible usage. We can still define a base structure, but each object can grow and be individual as needed without needing more derived/inherited objects. In addition, we can add even more encapsulated functionality, like we would through inheritance, by utilizing a property that all JavaScript objects have:

<h3>The Problem...</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<p class='content'>
So far we have built very specific objects.
<span class='emphasis'>person</span>
was an object that contained several defined properties, but was specific to only one person.
</p>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>let person = {
  name: "Shaun",
  age: 39,
  interests: ["programming", "Diablo", "cage fighting"],
  talk: function () {
    console.log("I'm 39");
  },
  walk: function (s) {
    posX += 5;
  },
  toHTML: function (selector) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = this.bio();
    document.querySelector(selector).append(div);
  },
  bio: function () {
    console.log(this);
    return `Hello I am ${this.name} 
      and I'm a ${this.age} year old 
      interested in ${this.interests[0]}`;
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>But what if we wanted to add another person? We could create a second version of the above code and just replace the information:</span>
</p>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>let person1 = {
  name: "Shaun",
  age: 39,
  interests: ["programming", "Diablo", "cage fighting"],
  toHTML: function (selector) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = this.bio();
    document.querySelector(selector).append(div);
  },
  bio: function () {
    console.log(this);
    return `Hello I am ${this.name} 
      and I'm a ${this.age} year old 
      interested in ${this.interests[0]}`;
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>let person2 = {
  name: "Janel",
  age: 34,
  interests: ["not programming", "not Diablo"],
  toHTML: function (selector) {
    let div = document.createElement('div');
    div.textContent = this.bio();
    document.querySelector(selector).append(div);
  },
  bio: function () {
    console.log(this);
    return `Hello I am ${this.name} 
      and I'm a ${this.age} year old 
      interested in ${this.interests[0]}`;
  }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p class='content'>
But I'm sure you can see why that would become tedious and unmanageable.
<br>
<span class='emphasis'>What would I do if needed to create a 100 people?</span>
<br>
<span class='emphasis'>What would I do if needed to give all the people a new property, like "gender"?</span>
<br>
<span class='emphasis'>Where would I store the hundreds of lines of code? I mean, there is only so much memory!</span>

<h3>The Solution... OBJECT CONSTRUCTORS</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>Object Constructors</span>
are simply just a standard function. We can use these to create a
<span class='emphasis'>blueprint (just like classes do)</span>
for what we want an object to look like -- any necessary
<span class='emphasis'>properties</span>
it may need to contain.
<br>
<span class='emphasis'>!!! REMEMBER: Properties in JavaScript can contain any value type INCLUDING function definitions. !!!</span>
</p>
<div class='row'>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<p class='content'>
In order for us to utilize object constructors we need to understand the concept of
<span class='emphasis'>this.</span>
<span class='emphasis'>this</span>
is a powerful keyword in object oriented programming. In objects
<strong>this</strong>
represents the owner object, which in the case of an object constructor, would be the wrapping function.
</p>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>REMEMBER:</span>
MOST things in JavaScript are already objects. This includes<span class='emphasis'>&nbsp;functions</span>.
</p>
</div>
<div class='col-sm-6'>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>// This is an object constructor. It is just a simple
// function. Remember: Most things in JavaScript are
// an Object. This includes functions!
function MyObjectConstructor (prop1, prop2, prop3) {
  // 'this' refers to MyObjectConstructor
  this.prop1 = prop1;
  this.prop2 = prop2;
  this.prop3 = prop3;
}</code></pre>

<h3>Example: Let's create an Object Constructor</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>REMEMBER: Object Constructors are just simply functions:</span>
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<div class='inst'>Create a new object constructor for</div>
<span class='emphasis'>person</span>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>function Person (name, age, interests) {
  this.name = name;
  this.age = age;
  this.interests = interests;
}</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>Above</span>
we created a new
<span class='emphasis'>function</span>
called
<span class='emphasis'>Person</span>
with
<span class='emphasis'>3 parameters</span>
:
<span class='emphasis'>name, age, and interests.</span>
</p>
<p class='content'>
Once again, don't forget:
<span class='emphasis'>REMEMBER: Object Constructors are just simply functions. You can call this function. It's not really going to do anything because it doesn't have a return value, but you're not going to break anything if you call it.</span>

<h3>Example: Adding Methods to our Object Constructor</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<p class='content'>
We don't have any methods in our object constructor. We definitely need our
<span class='emphasis'>bio</span>
and
<span class='emphasis'>toHTML</span>
methods so we can pass that functionality onto new objects we create with the constructor. So how do we do add the methods?
</p>
<p class='content'>
There are 2 way:
<span class='emphasis'>1) Properties: something we've done already!</span>
and
<span class='emphasis'>2) Prototypes: our answer to adding new functionality and inheritance</span>
<small>We'll be exploring prototypes next week. They're a rather large subject</small>
</p>
<p class='content'>
<span class='emphasis'>Let's add our methods to our constructor using simple properties:</span>
</p>
<ol start='2'>
<li>
<div class='inst'>Add the bio method to the object constructor function</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>this.bio = function () {
  console.log(this);
  return `Hello I am ${this.name} and I'm a ${this.age} year old interested in ${this.interests[0]}`;
};</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<div class='inst'>Add the toHTML method to the object constructor function</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>this.toHTML = function (selector) {
  let div = document.createElement('div');
  div.textContent = this.bio();
  document.querySelector(selector).append(div);
};</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
</section>
<section>
<header>
<h3>Using an Object Constructor</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<p class='content'>
What good is having this thing if we can't use it? Your likely goto method for using the object constructor would be to just execute it like any function:
</p>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>let shaun = Person("Shaun", 39, ["programming", "Diablo", "cage fighting"]);</code></pre>
<p class='content'>
However, this will return
<span class='emphasis'>undefined</span>
And you won't be able to access the name, age, or interests properties. So,
<span class='emphasis'>"What do we do?"</span>
to create our new person?
<span class='emphasis'>WE WILL NEED THE 'new' KEYWORD!</span>
</p>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>let variable = new ObjectConstructor("argument", "argument", "argument");</code></pre>
<p class='content'>
The
<span class='emphasis'>new</span>
keyword is what makes this whole thing doable.
<span class='emphasis'>new</span>
does the following:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It creates a new empty object</li>
<li>
It sets a new property on the object called
<span class='emphasis'>prototype</span>
</li>
<li>
It binds all the properties set with the
<span class='emphasis'>this</span>
keyword to the object
</li>
<li>It returns the newly created object</li>
</ol>
<p class='content'>
So I imagine you've deduced the importance of the two keywords
<span class='emphasis'>this</span>
and<span class='emphasis'>&nbsp;new</span>. Object constructors are just functions. That's it. That's all.
<span class='emphasis'>this</span>
gives our function properties.
<span class='emphasis'>new</span>
turns our function into an object. Very much like
<span class='emphasis'>instantiating an object from a Class.</span>

<h3>Example: Using OUR Object Constructor</h3>

<span class='emphasis'>Arsh</span>

<h3>Example: Adding a Unique Property to You</h3>
<hr>
</header>
<p class='content'>
In most strict class based languages, adding dynamic properties is not possible. In PHP you can dynamically add properties but not methods. In Ruby you can't do either. This isn't the case in JavaScript. In JavaScript you can do both by just creating a new property on the object and assigning it a variable. This means that our
<span class='emphasis'>objects can be unique</span>
from one another. Dave doesn't need to be the same as Arsh. Shaun can be different to. But now we have the power to start our objects with the same profile, then modify them with uniqueness afterwards.
</p>
<p class='content'>
Adding a new property to an object is very simple:
</p>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>obj.newProperty = "value";</code></pre>
<p class='content'>
We learned this in part one. Let's add a new property to the You object:
</p>
<ol start='7'>
<li>
<div class='inst'>
Add a
<span class='emphasis'>gender</span>
property to the
<span class='emphasis'>You</span>
object and assign it a value
</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>shaun.gender = "unicorn";</code></pre>
</li>
</ol>
<p class='content'>
As you can see,
<span class='emphasis'>it's no different than adding properties to any object</span>
</p>
<p class='content'>
Let's output our objects!
</p>
<ol start='8'>
<li>
<div class='inst'>
Output
<span class='emphasis'>Dave's</span>
bio to the
<span class='emphasis'>#bio1</span>
HTMLElement
</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>dave.toHTML('#bio1');</code></pre>
<div id='bio1'></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class='inst'>
Output
<span class='emphasis'>Arsh's</span>
bio to the
<span class='emphasis'>#bio1</span>
HTMLElement
</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>arsh.toHTML('#bio2');</code></pre>
<div id='bio2'></div>
</li>
<li>
<div class='inst'>
Output the following to the HTMLElement
<span class='emphasis'>#bio3</span>
</div>
<pre><code class='language-javascript'>const bio3 = document.querySelector('#bio3');
bio3.textContent = `${you.name} is a ${you.age} year old ${you.gender} who likes ${you.interests[0]}.`;</code></pre>
<div id='bio3'></div>
